*Welcome to the Frontend Developers community!* _Do not skim this announcement._

We’re glad you’re here. Please start by introducing yourself in #_intro, that way you’ll appear as an active member. You can then select a channel from the left menu. A few of note are #feedback, #javascript, #ladydevs and #interesting. Without speaking in #_intro you’ll become inactive and will be removed after a month. This community strictly follows the *don’t be a jerk* policy and is enforced by all members. So be *kind*, *helpful*, *don’t spam or pitch your product*, and refrain from *sexual* or *bigoted* behavior.

If you are new, and have questions that may be interpreted as ridiculous or silly by senior developers, feel free to ask them in #_help. You’re more than welcome to use that channel as a means to help you grow as a dev without feeling judged.  If you’re trying grow your skill, answer questions in there. We also recommend finding a channel that is related to your specific question, like #angular to seek deeper assistance.

Open discussion occurs in #_general and is typically not monitored by admins. #_general_dev is for on-topic development discussions.

If you’re `looking for work`, let the #_jobs_onsite and #_jobs_remote channel know so employers can reach out. If you’re a recruiter, please post positions within the #_jobs_onsite  channel. Feel free to spam this channel within reason. Make sure you indicate wether it is a local or remote position.

Our community assets, including the site and logo, can be found at https://github.com/orgs/frontenddevelopers. If you would like to update or change anything feel free to make a pull request. We’re looking for an intrepid developer to redesign and rebuild the http://frontenddevelopers.org site. Join us in #fed_production to learn more.

We’re a *“word of mouth”* community.  If you like what we’re doing, please share our homepage http://frontenddevelopers.org  with the #frontenddevelopers hash tag or click here https://goo.gl/DPgbTN to share on Twitter.

Finally, since the beginning, we’ve kept Frontend Developers free. We think that it provides a valuable service to the many developers that need it. However we have expenses. That’s why we’ve added the ability to donate to help provide the community with a fund that can be used can use to cover integration expenses, upgrades, create useful training content, and allow us to grow.
